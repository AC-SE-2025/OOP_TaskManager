# OOP TaskManager
1. Look over the code, and choose a method to implement.
2. Create a new *branch* named exactly the same as your chosen method (to be sure that no-one else has already taken your method!).
3. Implement your method without changing any of the other methods.
4. You can use the tests file, or create a new one if you prefer.
5. Once you have made some changes, you will need to *commit* them back to *your branch* to save them.
6. Once you are confident that your feature is correctly implemented, you can open a *pull request* to get the code from your branch merged back to the trunk (main branch).

# Once you are done, consider an enhancement
Consider starting work on an enhancement such as the following. These can be created as a new branch, but then may need to be further branched to keep track of the smaller tasks within them. 
1. Editing a task's details.
2. Adding tags or categories to tasks.
3. Implementing a user interface (CLI, GUI, or web-based).
4. Enhancing the file save/load mechanism with formats like JSON, SQL or CSV.
